	<!-- Question 3 answered here -->
 <p> My name is<strong> Natalie Fragnito.</strong> <ins>I am a second year student at NC State.</ins> 
 My major is <em>biomedical and health sciences engineering with an intended concentration in biomaterials and regenerative medicine.</em>
 I chose this major because I enjoy technology, medicine, and helping my community. </p>  


	<br />


<p>I am currently employed as an instructor at Snapology. 
In my job I teach introductory engineering concepts to children K-6. 
The students build motorized and programmed LEGO models to reflect the concepts taught in class.
I enjoy my job because I am able to encourage children to pursue hobbies related to STEM.</p>
